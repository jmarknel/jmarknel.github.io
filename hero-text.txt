				<p>The church in Austin isn't our name - it's our description.</p>
			<p>As such, it's an inclusive title, not an exclusive one. We gather together simply as believers of the Lord in this city, and we receive as our brothers and sisters all who believe in Jesus Christ. Likewise, we warmly welcome guests and visitors who are not Christians.</p>
